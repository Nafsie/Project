      <h2>1. Insulin Therapy</h2>
    <p class="column-66-p">People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin to manage blood sugar to survive. Many people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes also need insulin therapy.

        Many types of insulin are available, including short-acting (regular insulin), rapid-acting insulin, long-acting insulin and intermediate options. Depending on your needs, your provider may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use during the day and night.
        
        Insulin can't be taken orally to lower blood sugar because stomach enzymes interfere with insulin's action. Insulin is often injected using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen — a device that looks like a large ink pen.
        
        An insulin pump also may be an option. The pump is a device about the size of a small cellphone worn on the outside of your body. A tube connects the reservoir of insulin to a tube (catheter) that's inserted under the skin of your abdomen.</p>

      <h2>2. Oral Medications</h2>
    <p class="column-66-p">Oral diabetes medications (pills) help people with Type 2 diabetes manage blood sugar levels. There are several different types. You may need to take more than one kind or may have to take insulin and pills. Your healthcare provider can discuss your options and the pros and cons of each.
      Oral diabetes medications (taken by mouth) help manage blood sugar (glucose) levels in people who have diabetes but still produce some insulin — mainly people with Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.
      There are several different classes of diabetes medications that work in different ways to help manage blood sugar levels. They include:
      <ul class="column-66-p">
      <li>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.</li>
      <li>Biguanides</li>
      <li>Bile acid sequestrants (BASs).</li>
      <li>Dopamine-2 agonists.</li>
      <li>DPP-4 inhibitors (gliptins).</li>
      <li>Meglitinides (glinides).</li>
      <li>SGLT2 inhibitors</li>
      <li>Sulfonylureas.</li>
      <li>Thiazolidinediones (TZDs).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    
  </div>
  
    <div class="column-66">
      <h2>3. Blood Sugar Monitoring</h2>
    <p class="column-66-p">Depending on your treatment plan, you may check and record your blood sugar as many as four times a day or more often if you're taking insulin. Careful blood sugar testing is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range. 
        People with type 2 diabetes who aren't taking insulin generally check their blood sugar much less often.

        People who receive insulin therapy also may choose to monitor their blood sugar levels with a continuous glucose monitor. Although this technology hasn't yet completely replaced the glucose meter, 
        it can lower the number of fingersticks necessary to check blood sugar and provide important information about trends in blood sugar levels..</p>

      <h2>4. Healthy Diet</h2>
    <p class="column-66-p">Your diabetes diet is simply a healthy-eating plan that will help you control your blood sugar. 
        You'll need to focus your diet on more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains. 
        These are foods that are high in nutrition and fiber and low in fat and calories. 
        You'll also cut down on saturated fats, refined carbohydrates and sweets.
        In fact, it's the best eating plan for the entire family. Sugary foods are OK once in a while. 
        They must be counted as part of your meal plan.
        Managing blood sugar is the key to living well with diabetes, and eating well is the key to managing blood sugar. But what does it mean to eat well? Simply put, eat healthy foods in the right amounts at the right times so your blood sugar stays in your target range as much as possible.

Work with your dietitian or diabetes educator to create a healthy eating plan, and check out the resources in this section for tips, strategies, and ideas to make it easier to eat well.

      <h2>5. Regular Exercise</h2>
    <p class="column-66-p">If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes.
       Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage.
       Examples of moderate-intensity physical activities include:</p>
       <ul class="column-66-p">

       <li>Walking briskly</li>
       <li>Doing housework</li>
       <li>Mowing the lawn</li>
       <li>Dancing</li>
       <li>Swimming</li>
       <li>Bicycling</li>
       <li>Playing Sports</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="column-66-p">
       These activities work your large muscles, increase your heart rate, and make you breathe harder, which are important goals for fitness. 
       Stretching helps to make you flexible and prevent soreness after being physically active.
